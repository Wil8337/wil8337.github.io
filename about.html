         <h3>Tiger Wood’s Win at The Masters</h3>

         <p>This image is taken from Tiger Wood’s Win at The Masters in 2019. Tiger Woods is the best professional golfer to ever live. 
          In total Tiger has 82 PGA Tour Wins and 15 major tournament wins. He still holds the longest consecutive streak of being ranked 
          World #1 at 281 weeks. So you’re probably asking, why is this Master’s win so special? How is it any different from all of 
          Tiger's other wins in golf? It is because it was Tiger’s first major tournament win in 11 years. Not only that, but in the years 
          leading up to this win Tiger suffered major injuries that required numerous surgeries and faced many other struggles which 
          included legal, marital, and substance problems. By this point in his career, Tiger was no longer looked at as a serious contender 
          and had almost been written off by the golf community. Tiger’s win in 2019 was thought of as the unthinkable. Bettors who chose 
          to ride with Tiger in this tournament got paid handsomely. Tiger’s win at The Masters highlights true perseverance and 
          determination, especially when the odds are stacked against you. It is a constant reminder of why I love watching golf,  
          especially The Masters.
