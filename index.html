    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Wil Rinaldi and I’m a fourth year at Northeastern studying Finance, Entrepreneurship, and Data Science. 
        At Northeastern I play on the Club Hockey Team, and previously I played on the Rugby Team. I was raised just north of Boston 
        in a town called Lynnfield but I decided to go to a boarding high school in Connecticut in order to pursue a hockey career. 
        I am an only child with a Jack Russell Terrier named Chester. While I like to think I have many hobbies, my favorite by far 
        happens to be golf. I started playing with my Dad when I got to middle school and started to fall in love with the sport in 
        high school. I competed on my high school’s golf team and worked hard to be competitive in matches. While I thoroughly enjoyed 
        competing in the sport of golf, I would have to say that playing casually with friends, or even alone, is the best way to golf. 
        I love getting to be out in nature and enjoying the peace and quiet that golf courses have to offer. Aside from the other golfers, 
        it is just you, your golf clubs, and a beautifully landscaped scenery.</p>
